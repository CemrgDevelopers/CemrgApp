## Discussions page 
The best place to ask questions about the functionalities or how to do tasks, 
is in the [Discussions page](https://github.com/CemrgAppDevelopers/CemrgApp/discussions). 
You only need a github account, which can be setup for free. 
The answer to your question will remain in there, helping others with a similar query.
