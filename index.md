The Cardiac Electro-Mechanics Research Group Application (CemrgApp) is a platform with 
custom image processing and computer vision toolkits for applying statistical, 
machine learning, and simulation approaches to cardiovascular data. 
CemrgApp provides an integrated environment, where cardiac data visualisation and 
workflow prototyping are presented through a common user friendly graphical interface.
