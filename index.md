# CemrgApp: An Interactive Medical Imaging Platform with Image Processing and Computer Vision Toolkits for Cardiovascular Research

The Cardiac Electro-Mechanics Research Group Application (CemrgApp) is a platform with custom image processing and computer vision toolkits for applying statistical, machine learning, and simulation approaches to cardiovascular data. CemrgApp provides an integrated environment, where cardiac data visualisation and workflow prototyping are presented through a common user friendly graphical interface. CemrgApp at present supports:

+ Motion Quantification
+ Anatomical Measurements
+ Scar Quantification
+ Morphological Measurements
+ Electrophysiology Simulations

Please cite the following article, if you use CemrgApp in your project:
